# Auction Project
## Overview
This repository contains a decentralized auction platform written in Solidity, with a frontend built using Next.js and a backend powered by Nest.js. 
The aim of this project is to create a secure and transparent auction system leveraging blockchain technology.

# Project Components
## Smart Contracts (Solidity)

The core auction logic, including bidding, bid management, and winner selection, is implemented as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
The contracts ensure transparency and security, minimizing the need for a trusted third party.

## Frontend (Next.js)

The user interface for interacting with the auction platform is built using Next.js.
Provides a seamless and responsive user experience, enabling users to view auctions, place bids, and monitor their bid status.

## Backend (Nest.js)

The backend service is developed using Nest.js, managing user data, authentication, and interaction with the blockchain.
It provides RESTful APIs for frontend communication and integrates with the Ethereum network to facilitate smart contract transactions.

## Features
- Decentralized Auctions: Secure and transparent auctions on the Ethereum blockchain.
- User Authentication: Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Real-Time Updates: Real-time updates on auction status and bid placements.
- Responsive Design: User-friendly interface with support for multiple devices.
